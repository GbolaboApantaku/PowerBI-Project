Power BI Project


Project Overview
This Power BI project involved data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization to derive actionable insights. The dataset was processed using Power Query, and interactive dashboards were created to showcase key trends and patterns.

Activities Carried Out
Data Collection & Cleaning – Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and formatted data.
Data Transformation – Used Power Query to structure and optimize datasets for analysis.
Data Modeling – Established relationships between tables and created calculated columns and measures with DAX.
Dashboard & Visualizations – Developed interactive reports using charts, slicers, and KPIs.
Insights & Findings – Identified key trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
Visualizations
KPI Cards – Displayed key metrics.
Bar & Column Charts – Compared different categories and trends over time.
Line Charts – Showed trends and seasonality.
Pie Charts – Highlighted proportions and distributions.
Maps – Provided geographical insights.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated how Power BI can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights. The interactive dashboards help in making data-driven decisions efficiently.
